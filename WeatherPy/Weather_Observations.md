1. Strong correlation between temperature and latitude (Northern and Southern Hemisphere):

  - By looking at the scatter plot of Temperature vs Latitude and adding as complements the scatter plots of the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, we can appreciate that there is a tendency in all the cities that the closer to the 0 latitude, the hotter; and it actually makes sense, because the equator which is exactly in the 0 latitude, is the point in the world map that is closer to the sun, than any other point, latitude or longitude in the planet. To all these arguments we also, add that the r-value, is pretty high, so this is another point in advantage to conclude that the temperature and the latitude have a very strong correlation. Conclusion: The closer to latitude 0, the higher it gets the temperature.

2. Very low correlation between latitude vs wind speed, humidity and cloudiness (Northern and Southern Hemisphere):

  - In the other hand, we have the other three interest variables, which are humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness, against latitude, all these 3 variables are completely different from temperature, this is because humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness have a very low correlation with latitude, so it will get very complicated to predict or to store a tendency to point where or when will the humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness will higher or lower according to the latitude of the world. So in other words humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness are not affected by the latitude of the world.

3.  Wind Speed Factor (Northern and Southern Hemisphere):

  - Even though wind speed hasn't a strong correlation against the latitude, we can observe in the scatter plot that the in latitudes greater than 0, there are higher wind speeds than in latitudes lower than 0. So according to the scatter plot of Southern Hemisphere against wind speed and the  scatter plot of Northern Hemisphere against wind speed, we can conclude that in the Northern Hemisphere the wind speed tend/can reach higher speeds.
